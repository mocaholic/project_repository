 The CodePen challenge is a great opportunity to try something new. I have experience with `Angular.js` but haven't touched `Angular` much.

So here's a card gallery like the one I created in `React` [here](https://codepen.io/jh3y/pen/zaNvxr), but created in `Angular 6`. Prompted by someone asking how tricky it would be to create in `Angular` on Twitter.

Enjoy!
